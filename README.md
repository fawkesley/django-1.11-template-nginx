# Django 1.11 template

This creates an empty Django project with an example app, view, settings etc.

The motivation for making this was the several days I've spent doing the same type of Django setup for new projects.

## Usage

Get the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/paulfurley/django-1.11-template-nginx.git && cd django-1.11-template-nginx
```

Edit the `setup_repo` file with some variables for your new project.

Run `./setup_repo run` to create the new project directory.
